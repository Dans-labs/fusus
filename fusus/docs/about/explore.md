# Explore

There are various ways in which you can observe and check the outcome of
the pipeline process.

## Intermediate results

If not in *batch* mode, a wide range of intermediate results will be produced that you can inspect.

## Proofing

After the OCR step, the results can be collected and overlayed on the original page image,
where coloring is used to indicate the lavel of confidence of the OCR for that particular word or letter.


# Notebooks

You find example explorations in the notebooks.
They can best be viewed through *nbviewer*.
