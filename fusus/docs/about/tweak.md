# Tweak

There are a lot of parameters in the pipeline that can be tweaked.

!!! caution "Two-edged sword"
    When you change a parameter to improve a particular effect on a particular page,
    it may wreak havoc with many other pages.

    When you tweak, take care that you do it locally, on a single book, or a single page.

# Parameters

The parameters are documented in `fusus.parameters`.
