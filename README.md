# Fusus

This is a pipeline that transforms scanned pages into readable text.

The pages come from several printed Arabic books from the past few centuries.

The pipeline takes care of cleaning, OCR and postprocessing.

This is work done by Cornelis van Lit and Dirk Roorda.

There is more documentation about sources, the research project, and how to use
this software in the
[docs](https://among.github.io/fusus/).
