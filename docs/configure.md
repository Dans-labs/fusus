## Default settings

The default settings are listed in `parameters.py`.

There are several ways to override the defaults.

## Reconfigure

You can pass new values for the configuration settings to
the method `C.reconfigure()`.

## Pass parameters

Many methods accept parameters that override certain defaults
for the execution of that method.
